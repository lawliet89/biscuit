# Supported Features

The crate, does not support all, and probably will never support all of
the features described in the various RFCs, including some algorithms and verification.

A checkmark (✔) usually indicates that the particular feature is supported in the library, although
there might be caveats. Refer to the remark for the feature.

A cross (✘) usually indicates that the feature is _not_ supported by the library. If there is no
intention to ever support it, it will be noted in the remark.

A field that can be serialized or deserialized by the library, but with no particular handling will
be listed as unsupported.

## JWT Registered Claims

JWT Registered Claims is defined in
[Section 4 of RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4).

## JWT Private Claims

Optional private claims are supported as part of the [`biscuit::ClaimsSet`](https://lawliet89.github.io/biscuit/biscuit/struct.ClaimsSet.html)
struct. (_as of v0.0.2_)

## JSON Web Key (JWK)

JWK is defined in [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

Both `JWK` and `JWKSet`are supported (_as of v0.0.2_).

[JWK Thumbprint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638) is supported (_as of v0.5.0_).

JWK Common Parameters are defined in
[RFC 7517 Section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-4).

Additional key type specific parameters are defined in
[RFC 7518 Section 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-6), and additionally in
[RFC 8037](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037).

JWK is currently not used in signing JWS, pending features in `ring`. See this
[issue](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/445) in `ring`.
